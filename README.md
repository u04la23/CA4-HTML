## 1st Challenge: Finding inspiration
I have not seen many portfolios so I was not sure what to expect.

## 2nd Challenge: The About Page
Now from what I understood the about page would be talking about the
website rather than a "About Me" page on a portfolio.
So I decided that I talk mainly about the idea behind the website 
itself, the home page's features, and the chat application's too.

I used bootstrap's jumbotron in index.html however it did not give as much flexibility as i hoped it would.

I added some alerts in client.js to notify when a new user joined or when one leaves.
And I gave the users randomized colors so that they could be identified easily.
